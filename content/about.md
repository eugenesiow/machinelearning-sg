[machinelearning.sg](https://machinelearning.sg) is a ground-up effort to build and grow the machine learning community 
in Singapore.

[News @ machinelearning.sg](https://news.machinelearning.sg/) is a digital magazine that aims to be a place to discuss 
research and trends in artificial intelligence and machine learning. The goal is to provide accessible and technically 
informed overviews of the what's going on in AI/ML, as well as a platform for perspectives on recent developments and 
long-term trends. It is also built on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The community was started in late 2020 by [an ML researcher and software engineer](https://eugenesiow.com).
