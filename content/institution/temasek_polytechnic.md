description: 'Temasek Polytechnic (Abbreviation: TP) is a post-secondary academic
  institution located in Tampines, Singapore. It is the third polytechnic established
  in the country. Temasek Polytechnic has an industry-focused curriculum, which is
  an alternative to a broader based junior college/ pre-university education. Polytechnic
  graduates in Singapore are sought after for entry level positions or well-prepared
  to complete university degrees. In contrast to polytechnics in the United States
  and the UK, polytechnics in Singapore admit the majority of their students after
  secondary school, mostly at the age of 16-17(before receiving high school education),
  which is after ten years of formal education. A Temasek Polytechnic diploma in a
  specialised area of study, for example Law & Management, is awarded after completing
  three years of academic studies and a industry internship.'
