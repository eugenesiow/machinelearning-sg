description: 'Nanyang Polytechnic (Abbreviation: NYP) is a polytechnic located in
  the precinct of Yio Chu Kang in the town of Ang Mo Kio, Singapore. As an industry-oriented
  alternative to a broader based junior college education, polytechnic graduates in
  Singapore are sought after for work or many continue to complete university degrees.
  In contrast to polytechnics in the United States and UK, polytechnics in Singapore
  admit majority of its students after secondary school which is after 10 years of
  formal education. Diplomas in a specialised area of study, for example Biomedical
  Science, are awarded after completing 3 years of studies.'
