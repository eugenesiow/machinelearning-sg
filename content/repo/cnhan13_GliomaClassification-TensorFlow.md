description: In this project, a deep learning system is created to classify MRIs (volumetric)
  data from BRATS2015 to High/Low classes. The system comprises of data processing
  and 3d convolutional layers, 3d maxpool layers and functions to modularize similar
  group of layers to simplify the code. I used cross-validation to train and evaluate
  on 6 train/test sets with appropriate ratios of High/Low data.
