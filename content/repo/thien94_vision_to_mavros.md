description: A collection of ROS and non-ROS (Python) code that converts data from
  vision-based system (external localization system like fiducial tags, VIO, SLAM,
  or depth image) to corresponding mavros topics or MAVLink messages that can be consumed
  by a flight control stack (with working and tested examples for ArduPilot).
