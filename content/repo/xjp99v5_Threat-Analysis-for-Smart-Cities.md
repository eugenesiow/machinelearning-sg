description: A Cyber-Physical System (CPS) is a mixed system integrated with computation,
  communication, and physical processes, which takes an important position in the
  smart city, and there are many challenges in its security issues. In this project,
  we established a testbed and a mini UI system to verify our  CPS threat analysis
  method and auto anomaly detection algorithm.
