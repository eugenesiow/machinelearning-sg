description: Thanks to digitization, we often have access to large databases, consisting
  of various fields of information, ranging from numbers to texts and even boolean
  values. Such databases lend themselves especially well to machine learning, classification
  and big data analysis tasks. We are able to train classifiers, using already existing
  data and use them for predicting the values of a certain field, given that we have
  information regarding the other fields. Most specifically, in this study, we look
  at the Electronic Health Records (EHRs) that are compiled by hospitals. These EHRs
  are convenient means of accessing data of individual patients, but there processing
  as a whole still remains a task. However, EHRs that are composed of coherent, well-tabulated
  structures lend themselves quite well to the application to machine language, via
  the usage of classifiers. In this study, we look at a Blood Transfusion Service
  Center Data Set (Data taken from the Blood Transfusion Service Center in Hsin-Chu
  City in Taiwan). We used scikit-learn machine learning in python. From Support Vector
  Machines(SVM), we use Support Vector Classification(SVC), from the linear model
  we import Perceptron. We also used the K.neighborsclassifier and the decision tree
  classifiers. We segmented the database into the 2 parts. Using the first, we trained
  the classifiers and the next part was used to verify if the classifier prediction
  matched that of the actual values.
