description: Swarming behaviour is based on aggregation of simple drones exhibiting
  basic instinctive reactions to stimuli. However, to achieve overall balanced/interesting
  behaviour the relative importance of these instincts, as well their internal parameters,
  must be tuned. In this project, you will learn how to apply Genetic Programming
  as means of such tuning, and attempt to achieve a series of non-trivial swarm-level
  behaviours.
