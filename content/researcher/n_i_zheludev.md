bio: "Nikolay Zheludev FRS (born 23 April 1955) is a British scientist specializing\
  \ in nanophotonics, metamaterials, nanotechnology, electrodynamics, and nonlinear\
  \ optics. Nikolay Zheludev is one of the founding members of the closely interlinked\
  \ fields of metamaterials and nanophotonics that emerged at the dawn of the 21st\
  \ century on the crossroads of optics and nanotechnology. Nikolay\u2019s work focus\
  \ on developing new concepts in which nanoscale structuring of matter enhance and\
  \ radically change its optical properties."
