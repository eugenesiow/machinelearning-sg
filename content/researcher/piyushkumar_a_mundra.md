bio: I am a researcher at Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Sydney. I analyse
  next generation sequencing datasets (WES, WGS, RNAseq) from both cancer patients
  and preclinical models. In past 8 years, my experience focuses on machine learning
  applications to biological datasets, lipidomics, metabolomics, gene-expression variable
  selection, and network inference methods. I have been part of studies published
  in top-tier journals such as Nature Medicine, Circulation etc.
