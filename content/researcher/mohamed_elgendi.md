bio: My professional and academic interests span a number of research topics in medicine
  and engineering and my work to date has bridged these areas in innovative ways (areas
  include heart sound, speech, ECG, APG, EMG, EEG signal analysis and pattern recognition).
  I have vast experience collaborating across multiple disciplines in my projects
  which gives me a versatility to work among a variety of professions in engineering
  and medicine. Past and current projects include biomedical signal processing, neuroscience,
  machine learning, biometrics, social signal analysis, and data visualization.
