bio: Dr. Vladimir Kulish is an established academician with a focused interest in
  Thermo-Molecular Physics, Applied Mathematics, and Mechanical Engineering. Dr. Kulish
  has a Dr. Sc. in Physics and Mathematics from the Russian Academy of Sciences, a
  Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from Southern Methodist University (Dallas, Texas),
  and M. A. in German Language and Literature from the Goethe Institute (Luxembourg).
  Before Avantika, Professor Kulish was associated with the School of Mechanical and
  Aerospace Engineering at Nanyang Technological University (Singapore) as a regular
  faculty member for over 17 years. An ardent academician and researcher, Dr. Kulish's
  primary research interests are in the area of mathematical modeling of energy-informational
  transport processes, including transport phenomena in biological systems. Professor
  Kulish has been instrumental in developing a mathematical method (nowadays known
  as the method of Kulish). It allows solving complex problems in the areas of energy
  transport processes (e.g., ultra-fast heat transfer, start-up flows in nano-channels)
  and signal processing (e.g., biological signals such as electroencephalograms, electrocardiograms,
  and forecasting the behavior of multi-fractal time series). A celebrated author
  of six books and more than hundred publications in professional journals and peer-reviewed
  conference proceedings, Dr. Kulish is a holder of several prestigious awards for
  his scientific achievements. Dr. Kulish is Founder Vice-Chancellor of Avantika University.
  From June 2017 until June 2018, Dr. Kulish was Distinguished Professor at Avantika
  University. From July till November 2018, Dr. Kulish was Advisor for Research, Academics
  and International Relations (RAIR) for MIT Group of Institutions. Currently, Dr.
  Kulish is Visiting Professor at the Technion (Israel Institute of Technology).
