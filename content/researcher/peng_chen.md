bio: I am interested in the genetics and epigenetics of human complex diseases and
  traits. The diseases I have investigated include mental disorders, diabetes, and
  cardiovascular diseases. I analyzed NGS data of Singapore Malays and Indians, interpret
  SNPs and CNVs found in these populations, and establish connection between these
  variants to clinical phenotypes. I have also analyzed DNA methylation data from
  Illumina HM450K array. Currently, I am leveraging and developing various bioinformatics
  tools in analyzing the whole genome sequencing data of 300 Pima Indians in Arizona.
  In addition to SNPs, I put great efforts to investigate the association between
  obesity and copy number variations. The study on more complex structure variants,
  such as translocation and inversion, is also ongoing. I have published more than
  30 research articles in first class scientific journals, including Nature Nanotechnology,
  Nature Genetics, Diabetes and Human Molecular Genetics. These articles have been
  cited for more than 470 times, total impact factor reached 238 and my individual
  H-index is 13. Among them, there are 9 articles which I published as the first author
  (total impact factor is 74).
