bio: In 2010, I received a B.Sc. in biomedical engineering from biomedical engineering
  dept., Helwan University, Egypt. In 2014, I received an Erasmus Mundus joint master
  degree in computer vision and robotics (VIBOT). I've attended three different universities.
  i.e., University of Burgundy (Dijon, France), University of Girona (Girona, Spain),
  and heriot watt university (Edinburgh, Scotland). I've done my master thesis at
  Le2i, UMR CNRS 6303, University of Burgundy (Dijon, France). I received a Ph.D.
  in computer science from University of Montpellier, France. The Ph.D. was funded
  by Institute Mines-Telecom, France and A*STAR Research Attachment Program (ARAP),
  Singapore. Currently, I am working as a research fellow at ST Engineering-SUTD Cyber
  Security Laboratory, Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). My research
  interests are in the areas of machine learning, biomedical signal analysis, medical
  image analysis, ambient assisted living.
