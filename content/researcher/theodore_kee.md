bio: My personal goal and vision are for Singapore to be a leader in clinical innovation
  in the coming age of AI in medical software, clinical decision support, and digital
  therapeutics. We live in an exciting age of biomedical innovation with AI and digital
  therapeutics creating new and redefining regulatory guidelines and standards, that
  recently the European Union and FDA have begun to address and codify. Singapore
  is poised to be a leader in the emergent AI and digital therapeutic fields and interventional
  biomedical technologies. Our efforts with the Health Sciences Authority of Singapore
  and other relevant regulatory bodies like the National Healthcare Group Domain Specific
  Review Boards (NHG DSRB) have been insightful in identifying regulatory guidelines
  and implementing clinical trial designs for improving the metrics for real world
  evidence with CURATE.AI to change or supplement standard of care with evidence-based
  medicine.
