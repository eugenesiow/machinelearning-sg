bio: I am interested in the creation of novel adaptive models and software tools to
  help understand biological data. For example, understanding proteomic and genomic
  data such as protein structure and post translational modifications. The research
  requires knowledge in computer science, machine learning/artificial intelligence,
  statistics, mathematics and software engineering.
