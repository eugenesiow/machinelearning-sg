bio: As an engineering researcher, I am interesting in the development of principles
  and devices that are able to enhance the human-machine interacting experiences,
  particularly in medical applications. In the past, I have dedicated to several research
  projects, such as robotic flexible endoscopic surgery, force sensing tool for retinal
  surgery, and non-invasive localization system for nasogastric intubation. By identifying
  limitations and constraints in the existing medical instrumentation, I am interested
  to investigate the viability of integrating or introducing innovative technologies
  to enhance the performance of the medical participant, and even to enable them to
  perform tasks which are not attainable through conventional methods.
