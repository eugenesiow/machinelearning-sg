bio: I am a Professor of IT at UNSW Australia, Canberra Campus, Australia. From 2016-2019,
  I was fortunate to be the vice-president for Technical Activities for the IEEE Computational
  Intelligence Society, and the National President for the Australian Society for
  Operations Research. With close to 30 years of industrial and academic experience,
  200+ refereed publications, my research contributes to autonomy with an aim to design
  next generation trusted artificial intelligence systems that seamlessly integrate
  humans and machines. My work integrates cognitive science, operations research and
  artificial intelligence. I am a fellow of IEEE, a fellow of the UK Operational Research
  Society, a fellow of the Australian Computer Society, a fellow of the Institute
  of Managers and Leaders, an Associate Editor of IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks
  and Learning Systems, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, IEEE Transactions
  on Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems, and four
  other journals. I am also the Founding Editor-in-Chief for the IEEE Transactions
  on Artificial Intelligence.
