bio: Martin Wasser is a Bioinformatics Scientist with over 20 years of research experience
  in experimental biology and over 10 years in scientific software development. He
  has a wide spectrum of computational and data analytics skills, including proficiency
  in many programming languages (Java, C++, C#, Python, SQL), machine learning, computer
  vision, optimization and relational databases. He obtained the Biology degree (Diplom)
  from the University of Cologne, Germany in 1993. In 1998, he obtained his PhD in
  Molecular & Cell Biology from the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology at the
  National University of Singapore (NUS). In 2004, he received a Masters of Technology
  (MTech) in Knowledge Engineering from the Institute of System Sciences. In his early
  research career, he investigated nuclear architecture, cell proliferation and chromatin
  structure in the context of Drosophila development. In 2007, he joined the Bioinformatics
  Institute (BII) at A*STAR as a Principal Investigator to focus on live cell imaging
  and image analysis. Major achievements were the development of a model system for
  muscle atrophy based on live imaging of Drosophila metamorphosis and the discovery
  of a new cancer-related gene. His group also collaborated with various academic
  researchers to develop custom software for digital pathology. More information can
