bio: My primary academic interest lies in bridging the gap in the research pertaining
  to the interdisciplinary field wherein mechanical and materials engineering are
  brought together with chemical and biological science to study and fabricate nature-inspired
  composite materials. I design next-generation composite materials via advanced manufacturing
  technologies including 3D printing, with an emphasis on sustainability for load-bearing
  structures, textiles, energy, and environmental applications. I am also interested
  to explore the hierarchical architectures and geometries effect in designing composites
  with unprecedented multifunctional properties. The desired outcomes of my research
  include discovering the structure, composition, and property relationship behavior
  of composite materials along with the exploration of the relationship between the
  multi-scale geometric design of hierarchical architectures and the multifunctionality.
