bio: My specialty is information retrieval and ranking from big semi-structured data
  using machine learning techniques. I have been mastering computer programming, data
  extraction, loading, transformation, statistics, machine learning, and web development
  for many years. I noticed that talking to people is as important as getting the
  data, processing and delivering. You have to dig deep to understand how to convert
  what humans do easily into a computer software. The data to support is usually not
  great so and open communication channel with domain experts helps to bridge the
  gap. Once the gap is understood then I build tools, devices, and automation to create
  machine learning solutions even faster.
