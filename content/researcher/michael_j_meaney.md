bio: Michael J. Meaney, CM, CQ, FRSC, (born 1951) is a professor at McGill University
  specializing in biological psychiatry, neurology, and neurosurgery, who is primarily
  known for his research on stress, maternal care, and gene expression. His research
  team has "discovered the importance of maternal care in modifying the expression
  of genes that regulate behavioral and neuroendocrine responses to stress, as well
  as hippocampal synaptic development" in animal studies. The research has implications
  for domestic and public policy for maternal support and its role in human disease
  prevention and economic health.
