bio: I am a scientist who is interested in developing highly functional machines,
  which are able to perform precise micro/nano-manipulation tasks. To achieve this
  objective, my research has mainly focused on two domains - 1. design and control
  of un-tethered miniature robots and 2. design for large-scale flexure mechanisms
  that can deliver high precision capabilities.
