  \ this might be a good fit.\n\nYou'll be working on two well-crafted apps \u2013\
  \ a patient-facing mobile app, as well as a web-based app for coaches. Our work\

  \ working with us. This is a chance to do work that has a meaningful and direct\
  \ impact on people's health and lives \u2013 you'll be able to see first-hand how\
  \ our patients become healthier as a result of using the app. If you're excited\
  \ by this and having a hand in disrupting the healthcare industry, we'd love to\
  \ talk to you!"
