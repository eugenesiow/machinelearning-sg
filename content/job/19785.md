description: "Introduction\nETH Zurich is one of the leading universities of the world\
  \ with a strong focus on science and engineering. In 2010 it established the Singapore-ETH\
  \ Centre (SEC) in collaboration with the National Research Foundation (NRF) to do\
  \ interdisciplinary research on pressing problems.\nIn collaboration with the National\
  \ University of Singapore (NUS), the Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Duke\
  \ - NUS, the National Health Group (NHG), National University Health System (NUHS),\
  \ and SingHealth, SEC is undertaking a research programme on \"Future Health Technologies\
  \ (FHT)\". It addresses some immanent health challenges by developing a future-oriented\
  \ Mobile Digital Health Concept that tackles the increase in patients suffering\
  \ from chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity and stroke, as a consequence of\
  \ a rapidly ageing population with mobile digital technologies, covering the value\
  \ chain from acute care to patient's private homes.\nProject background\nFHT is\
  \ collecting health-related data at the participant\u2019s home and delivering digital\
  \ health solutions using mobile apps (e.g. conversational agent (chatbot), gait\
  \ analysis, gamified rehabilitation protocols), robotic assessment and therapy devices\
  \ (e.g., for neurorehabilitation of upper limb sensorimotor impairments), and sensors\
  \ for gait analysis. To build up and maintain a secure data collection and transfer\
  \ to the FHT server infrastructure, FHT is looking for an experienced Software Developer\
  \ to work with an international team of researchers and technicians from ETH Zurich\
  \ and multiple local partners in Singapore, including the Nanyang Technological\
  \ University, the Centre of Healthy and Sustainable Cities at Nanyang Technological\
  \ University (CHESS), the Saw Swee Hock School Of Public Health, and the Tan Tock\
