description: "We are looking for a brilliant full stack developer to join an exciting\
  \ startup that is well-funded alongside a team of leading domain experts in investment\
  \ banking, management consulting, data scientists and economists, to create a world-class\
  \ application that will have a global customer base with ambitions to be a world\
  \ beater and leader. Among team members are PhD\u2019s in data science and economics,\
  \ as well as some of the most experienced domain experts in their fields globally.\n\
  \nThe app is being built by and hosted on OutSystems in order to maximise the capabilities\
  \ of the platform. Our philosophy on tech is to outsource to best-of-class where\
  \ it is available at a reasonable cost without compromise, upgrade to new capabilities\
  \ early and focus our resources on areas where we have real value to add. Our platform\
  \ involves a large data lake with MS SQL, NoSQL, MongoDB, Neo4j Graph database,\
  \ hosted on AWS and Google Cloud, .Net and C# on OutSystems, Python for data science,\
  \ machine learning and natural language processing, Datarobot for machine learning,\
  \ Dialogflow chatbot, Java, CSS all combined to deliver a cutting edge app with\
  \ an amazing UI/UX.\nWe want our developers to add value above this integrated application\
  \ managed by OutSystems for us and not waste time and resources on the infrastructure\
  \ that is outsourced to OutSystems. The developers we would like to hire must have\
  \ intellectual curiosity and a strong interest in testing new technologies and constantly\
  \ looking for ways to improve and upgrade the existing platform, proactively bringing\
  \ new ideas to the business side in collaboration to constantly improving all aspects\
  \ from database to AI to UI/UX. \n\nThe applicants should have a minimum of 3 years\
  \ OutSystems experience, strong coding skills and good understanding across the\
  \ platform. A back-end and a front-end specialisation can be accommodated but having\
  \ a full stack, all-round athlete capability is important as well. OutSystems certification\
  \ is a plus but not essential as long as the candidate is willing to obtain it quickly\
  \ through online courses offered. However, understanding and appreciation of leveraging\
  \ the capabilities of OutSystems is a must in combination with the desire to incorporate\
  \ other best-of-class systems into the OutSystems platform. Strong university degrees\
  \ but more importantly, mastery of coding are a pre-requisite. \n\nUnderstanding\
  \ systems architecture, tradeoffs of database design and optimisation, Python, Javascript,\
  \ Rest API/SOAP and CSS are important skills. The most important skill is the willingness\
  \ to pick up new things you don't know quickly and never accepting \"no it cannot\
  \ be done\" as an answer.\n\nA quick career path to CTO is available for the right\
  \ candidate. Remuneration would be at competitive market salaries and stock options\
  \ for proven team members. This is a challenging job and we are looking for hard\
  \ working, ambitious and smart partners in our technology team to work hand in hand\
  \ with our strong domain experts.\n"
