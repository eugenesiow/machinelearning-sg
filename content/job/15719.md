description: 'Zendesk is looking for a Staff Software Engineer to join the Agent Experience
  Messaging team. As part of the Chat product office in Singapore, the team focuses
  on empowering our customers to provide a best-in-class messaging experience for
  their users. We are delivering a revamped customer messaging experience that will
  eventually culminate in the realisation of an omni-channel customer engagement product.

  As a Staff Engineer at Zendesk you will take an active part in our effort to meet
  our requirements, among them: better tools to set up and operate their service,
  automation and machine learning, increased security, detailed reporting capabilities,
  performance and availability.

  You would contribute application development directly, own the design and implementation
  of projects, and be involved in technical discussions beyond their teams. You should
  love finding simple solutions to sophisticated problems, and care about not only
  the technical and algorithmic aspects of large systems.

  The Zendesk Singapore teams achieve a high degree of autonomy by combining designers,
  QA engineers, product managers and software engineers collaborating together.

  What you get to do every day:


  Work closely with the Product Manager and the Designer to provide technical insights
  and early estimates on upcoming projects.

  Take the lead on technical design discussions and propose creative solutions on
  backend components and frontend layers.

  Build POCs to test technologies and make informed decisions.

  Ensure scalability, performance, maintainability and security of the technology
  platform in collaboration with ops teams.

  Participate in all phases of the software lifecycle.

  Become a catalyst to better working practices across Zendesk.

  Mentor and guide junior team members by reviewing their code submissions, code pairing,
  and being a sounding board.


  How you will make a difference:


  Have a career in Software Engineering with strong capabilities in Java, Python or
  Node.js. and practiced both frontend and backend technologies.

  Delivered Enterprise Grade software in a SAAS company.

  With proven understanding of architecture of highly concurrent and low latency systems
  and common tradeoffs with regard to performance, scalability and reliability

  Take a mature and pragmatic approach when choosing technologies.

  Put the customer first and respect your dedication to deliver, and not afraid to
  raise voice when needed and listen to others.

  Personal projects, contribution to open-source community or active learning initiatives
  would be a good sign of your passion to learn and tackle problems!


  Culture and Perks

  We have 100s of engineers in our Singapore office which is home to our highly successful
  Chat product. You can find us at Marina One West Tower. We approach work with calm,
  focus, a sense of humour whilst keeping sane working hours. At Zendesk, we also
  have a culture where ideas come from the bottom up - we have yearly company hackathons!

  Perks include stock options, flexible working, $1500 training allowance, medical
  cover, mobile phone allowance and 4 months parental leave. These are always subject
  to change and usually in the positive.'
