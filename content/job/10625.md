description: "About ADSC:\nIllinois At Singapore Pte. Ltd./ Advanced Digital Sciences\
  \ Center (ADSC) is a research centre of University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign,\
  \ funded by Singapore government agency, National Research Foundation (NRF).\nADSC\
  \ is home to approximately 50 researchers and students focusing on breakthrough\
  \ innovations in information technologies supporting interactive cyber infrastructures\
  \ that are expected to have a major impact in transforming humans\u2019 use of information\
  \ in data-intensive, technologically developed societies. ADSC\u2019s research mission\
  \ is carried out through projects that facilitate interactions among UIUC researchers,\
  \ local researchers and their industry partners. Through this, ADSC aims to enhance\
  \ Singapore\u2019s position as a hub for leading edge research.\nFor more information,\
  \ please visit ADSC's website http://adsc.illinois.edu/.\nProject: FPGA supported\
  \ new computing paradigm\nData analytics and security protocols are critical components\
  \ in the modern industrial applications, e.g., Power Grids, Water Supply System.\
  \ However, the high computational complexity of these components presents a critical\
  \ challenge towards their broader adoption in real-time and power-efficient scenarios.\
  \ FPGAs are poised to take a significant role for high-performance and energy-efficient\
  \ computation. However, implementing effective functionalities onto FPGAs remains\
  \ problematic. To address these challenges, systematic design solution together\
  \ with the in-depth domain specific architecture exploration is required.\nWe are\
  \ currently looking for a Research Engineer to conduct research and development\
  \ for new solutions for high performance real-time data processing (including both\
  \ analytics and encryption/decryption algorithms). This project will deal with cross-level\
  \ hardware software co-design, and aim to deliver industrial standard deliveries.\n\
  The position requires:\n\nBS or MS in computer engineering/science, electrical engineering,\
  \ or a related field.\nFPGA design experience is a must.\nProficient in Python,\
  \ C/C++ programming and Verilog/VHDL programming.\nExperience in machine learning\
  \ related projects is preferred.\nGood communication skills and able to work under\
  \ stress.\n\nApplication Instructions:\nInterested candidates should apply online\
  \ at\_https://my.engr.illinois.edu/apply/.\nIMPORTANT: Applications will be considered\
  \ until the corresponding position has been filled. Only shortlisted candidates\
  \ will be notified.\nADSC\_is\_an\_equal\_opportunity\_employer\_committed\_to\_\
