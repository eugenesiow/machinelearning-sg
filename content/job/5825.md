description: "AI Singapore (AISG) is a national AI programme launched by the National\
  \ Research Foundation (NRF) to anchor deep national capabilities in Artificial Intelligence\
  \ (AI). \n\nThe programme office is hosted by the National University of Singapore\
  \ (NUS) and brings together all Singapore-based research institutions and the vibrant\
  \ ecosystem of AI start-ups and companies developing AI products to perform use-inspired\
  \ research, grow the knowledge, create the tools, and develop the talent to power\
  \ Singapore's AI efforts.\nAISG Federated Learning team aims to address the issues\
  \ of privacy-preserving in machine learning. In many machine learning projects,\
  \ limited data often hinders the improvement of the model performance. One potential\
  \ approach is to look to augment the existing data with more data (either in terms\
  \ of volume and features). However, given the increasing awareness of data privacy,\
  \ data augmentation with the data from external organizations has created some concerns\
  \ too. Federated Learning is a new machine learning paradigm introduced to facilitate\
  \ model training without the need of data transfer/sharing across organizations.\
  \ With Federated Learning, multiple parties jointly train a model. Each party shares\
  \ its local model, which is trained with its own local data. All the local models\
  \ are then aggregated to form the global model.\nThe AISG Federated Learning team\
  \ is looking for engineers to work together at the intersection of machine learning,\
  \ distributed system, and cryptology.\nAs a member of the AISG Federated Learning\
  \ team, you will be required to:\n\nBuild and maintain a Federated Learning platform\
  \ for AISG internal & external usage.\nPropose and drive technical decisions for\
  \ completion.\nEducate the broad community of data scientists/engineers about the\
  \ importance of privacy-preserving machine learning.\nMentor AISG Apprentices and\
  \ others from a privacy-preserving machine learning perspective.\n\nQualifications:\n\
  To succeed in this role you would likely have a majority of the following knowledge\
  \ and skills:\n\nHave held at least one ML or software engineering related position\
  \ for a minimum of 3 years.\nFamiliarity in Federated Learning or other privacy-preserving\
  \ machine learning technologies.\nProficient in at least one commonly used programming\
  \ language, such as Python, Ruby, Go, Rust, Java, C#, C++, etc.\nExcellent communication\
  \ skills, including thoughtful listening skills and the ability to express complex\
  \ ideas clearly and succinctly.\nFamiliarity with Clouds such as AWS, Microsoft\
  \ Azure, Google Cloud Platform and code deployment tools.\nPrior experience in building\
  \ large scale distributed systems.\nPrior experience in building systems to support\
  \ edge computing and IOT would be a plus.\nFamiliarity in cryptology technologies,\
  \ such as Homomorphic Encryption, Secure multi-party computation, etc. would be\
  \ a plus\n"
