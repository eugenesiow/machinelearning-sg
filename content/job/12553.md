  \ a system. Major Tasks include:\n\n\nDesign, develop and modify software systems,\
  \ using scientific analysis and mathematical models to predict and measure outcome\
  \ and consequences of design\nStore, retrieve, and manipulate data for analysis\
  \ of system capabilities and requirements\nAnalyse user needs/product specifications\
  \ and software requirements to determine feasibility of design within time and cost\
  \ constraints\nConfer with systems analysts, engineers, programmers and others to\
  \ design system and to obtain information on product/ project limitations and capabilities,\
  \ performance requirements and interfaces\nImplement change requirements of software\
  \ to correct errors, allow it to adapt to hardware, or to improve its performance\n\
  \nDetailed Responsibilities\n\n1. Product Development/ Project Implementation\n\n\
  Design algorithm/implementation verification and validation framework\nApplication\
  \ level hardware integration\nBuild plans for change requirements of systems components\
  \ (as is necessary)\nPrepare detailed resource plan and product development/project\
  \ schedule (including testing schedule)\nComplete the detailed design of the product/system\
  \ (both hardware and software)\nValidate the detailed design of the product/system\
