description: "Bioinformatics Research Fellow\n\nWe are a growing team of scientists\
  \ developing the next generation of multi-omic single cell measurements and Crispr\
  \ based therapeutic approaches.\n\nWe do a lot of DNA sequencing. We sequence to\
  \ find mutations, we sequence to measure genae expression and we sequence to make\
  \ protein measurements. We have multiple high impact, clinically relevant projects\
  \ that require new computational approaches to analyze.\n\nGene Yeo is a visiting\
  \ PI at NUS and a full professor at UCSD, where his lab has a team of computational\
  \ biologists and software developers and it will be important for someone who has\
  \ the following criteria.\_\n\nWe are looking for someone who has completed:\n1)\
  \ a PhD in bioinformatics or related computational fields.\n2) good communications\
  \ skills and can interact with biologists and informaticians both here and at UCSD.\n\
  3) a background in sequence data analysis\n4) Single cell and multi-omic / multi-data\
  \ type analysis, cancer biology and machine learning experience are considered a\
  \ plus.\n\nIn your cover letter, give a brief description of relevant work you have\
  \ done, tell us why you want to work on cutting edge technical problems and provide\
  \ a timeline for when you can join us."
